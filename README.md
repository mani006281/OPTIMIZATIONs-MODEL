In Task-4 of the CODTECH internship, the goal was to solve a practical business problem using optimization techniques. The task focused on helping a company decide how many units of two products—Product A and Product B—it should produce to earn the highest possible profit. However, the company has limited resources like labor hours and raw materials, so we had to make sure those limits weren’t crossed.

To build the solution, we used Python along with a library called PuLP. This library makes it easy to apply linear programming by letting us define the profit formula and the resource limits clearly. We wrote the entire code in a Jupyter Notebook, which is a great platform because it allows us to write code, add explanations, and view results all in one place.

After solving the problem using this approach, the model suggested that producing 30 units of Product A and 40 units of Product B would give the company the highest profit—₹2200—without going over the available labor or materials. This task was a hands-on way to learn how to use optimization to make smarter business decisions using simple tools like Python and PuLP.
